<body><pre><b><p class="b">Dear Teacher Matt,
Thanks for your teaching. Thanks to your help, I've passed the oral and writing part this year.
After the end of  the oral class, we have only met at the forest park once. 
Although we don't meet frequently, you actually teach me grammer and vocabulary per week by correcting my writing part.
Honestly, I always feel nervous when I get my paper back. Therefore, I am not used to checking my paper immediately.<i class="far fa-grin-beam-sweat"></i>
I will try to change the habit. 
Hopefully, I will be able to conquer my fear and keep learning from my mistakes.
Happy Teachers' Day<i class="far fa-laugh-squint"></i>
					


Naughty girl,
彥均 Rita</b></pre></p>
